    <h1>Welcome to CSD430 Server Side Development Project Panel</h1>
    <h2>Usiel Figueroa</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Principles of programming for the World Wide Web (WWW)</strong> are explored using modern Java technologies. The project focuses on leveraging Jakarta Enterprise Edition (EE) specifications to establish foundational and advanced web application development practices.
</p>

<p>
    The mission of the project is to develop client-server web applications that effectively handle user requests over the web. Emphasis is placed on building reliable, scalable solutions that align with industry standards.
</p>

<p>
    Explore the <strong>REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) API</strong> architectural style, learning how to structure applications around resources and HTTP methods. RESTful design principles will be central to handling communication between client and server components.
</p>

<p>
    Key programming operations such as <strong>CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD)</strong> will be used to create and manage data elements within these web applications. The project also examines security concerns within Jakarta EE environments to help and build secure web applications. Preparing for real-world web development scenarios.
